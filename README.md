# Netflix Clone

This project is a simple clone of the Netflix landing page, built using HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript. The page replicates the layout and design of the Netflix homepage, including a responsive interface that adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices. The design includes a navigation bar, featured content sections, and a FAQ Section with Acordian buttons, mimicking the original Netflix aesthetic. The use of JavaScript is minimal, focusing on enhancing user interaction, such as toggling the FAQ accordian information.
